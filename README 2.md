# Fundamentals Review
Start by taking out a piece of paper. Use it to write down your mistakes along the way while you're completing the below problems, so you can keep track and start looking for any patterns.

Complete each of the following steps:

1. Fork and clone this repo

1. Start by typing out all the functions from `step-one.js`. Type them word for word. Also, **add your own comments to describe what each line of the function is doing.** Do NOT copy and paste the code. Type out everything! This will help build muscle memory and increase your recollection.

1. Rewrite the functions, and fill out the missing parts of the functions in `step-two.js`. Fill out the portions that say 'Your code here' in order to completed the functions.

1. Fill out `step-three.js` and write the functions from scratch.

1. Make a pull request with your completed work
